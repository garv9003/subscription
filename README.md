# Subscription Management with Web3

## 📌 Project Description

The **Subscription Management with Web3** project aims to build a decentralized subscription platform using blockchain technology. Users can subscribe, renew, and manage their subscriptions through a trustless and transparent smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The system ensures secure and automatic access control based on subscription status.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To empower digital creators, service providers, and platforms with a decentralized method to manage recurring subscription-based payments without the need for intermediaries or centralized platforms. This fosters transparency, autonomy, and global accessibility.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔐 **Decentralized Access Control**: No central authority needed to manage or verify subscription status.
- 💸 **On-chain Payments**: Secure payment handling using Ethereum's native currency (ETH).
- 🕒 **Time-bound Subscriptions**: Fixed duration subscriptions with automatic expiry.
- ♻️ **Renewal Support**: Users can renew subscriptions seamlessly on-chain.
- 📊 **Status Query**: Anyone can check if an address has an active subscription.
- 👑 **Owner Controls**: Admin can update subscription fees and withdraw collected funds.

## 🌱 Future Scope

- ⚙️ **Integration with Frontend DApps**: Connect the smart contract with a React.js-based DApp for user interaction.
- ⌛ **Custom Duration Subscriptions**: Allow providers to define various subscription tiers and durations.
- 🪙 **ERC20 Token Support**: Support for stablecoins like USDC or DAI for payments instead of ETH.
- 📢 **Notifications**: Email/Telegram alerts for expiring subscriptions via Chainlink oracles.
- 🔐 **NFT-Based Access Passes**: Issue NFTs as proof of subscription ownership and access rights.
